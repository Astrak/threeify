# three.ts

Prototype of a Typescript-based Three.js focused on just proving Typescript can build and load into the browser with minimal effort.

To run:

1. Install node.js & npm as appropriate for your platform.
2. Run npm install to install all the required node modules from package.json

```
npm install
```
 
3. Run webpack in dev-server mode, which includes hot-reloading

```
npm run start
```
 
Then open a web server to the address displayed in the console.  Usually this will be https://localhost:8000.

```
/index.html
```
