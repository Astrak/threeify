# Threeify

A Typescript 3D Library loosely based on Three.js

To run:

1. Install node.js & npm as appropriate for your platform.
2. Run npm install to install all the required node modules from package.json

```
npm install
```
 
3. To run the automatic typescript builder and dev server go:

```
npm run dev
```
 
Then open a web server to the address displayed in the console.  Usually this will be http://localhost:8000.

It will automatically rebuild your code on each change.

```
/index.html
```

Optionally, use theia-ide to start coding immediately. If you have docker and docker-compose available do:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

theia-ide is available at http://localhost:3000. Perform step 2 and 3 in the theia-ide terminal.
