# Threeify

A Typescript 3D Library loosely based on Three.js

To run:

1. Install node.js & npm as appropriate for your platform.
2. Run npm install to install all the required node modules from package.json

```
npm install
```
 
3. To run the automatic typescript builder and dev server go:

```
npm run dev
```
 
Then open a web server to the address displayed in the console.  Usually this will be https://localhost:8000.

It will automatically rebuild your code on each change.
