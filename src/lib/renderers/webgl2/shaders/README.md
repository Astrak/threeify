# General

## Goals

* Include glsl files should be functions only.
* Shaders should be straight forward and avoid indirection or complex defines.

## Challenges

* How to support a node-based shader graph system?  Can I skip that in the near term?  Yes.

## Changes from Three.js

* A complete rewrite.
